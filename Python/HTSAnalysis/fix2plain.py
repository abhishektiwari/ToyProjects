# The New-FIX format is defined by a header and then two or more data 
# lines. The header must start with "@$" and the rest of the line is 
# treated as a comment. The data lines are four numbers separated by 
# valid separators (i.e., tab, space, comma). The four order specific
# numbers are the hormone concentration, an estimate of the precision
# of the hormone concentration, the time value, and the number of 
# sample replicates. Missing values are indicated by a zero in the 
# fourth column.
