# The New-FIX format is defined by a header and then two or more data 
# lines. The header must start with "@$" and the rest of the line is 
# treated as a comment. The data lines are four numbers separated by 
# valid separators (i.e., tab, space, comma). The four order specific
# numbers are the hormone concentration, an estimate of the precision
# of the hormone concentration, the time value, and the number of 
# sample replicates. Missing values are indicated by a zero in the 
# fourth column.

# VisPulse need input time series of 145 time points. Our time series 
# is small (nearly 60 data points), so padding the rest of our time 
# series with the last sample value, so that it is 145 in length.
